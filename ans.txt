Database Schema Rationale:

For development, we've opted for SQLite due to its lightweight nature and ease of setup. SQLite simplifies local development, making it perfect for testing and debugging code before deployment.

In production, we'll transition to PostgreSQL, a robust and scalable relational database. PostgreSQL's advanced features will ensure data consistency, reliability, and efficient handling of millions of votes, meeting the demands of our live voting application.
